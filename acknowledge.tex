\chapter*{Acknowledgments}\label{C:ack} % Any acknowledgments should go % in here, between the title page and the table of contents.  The % acknowledgments do not form a proper chapter, and so don't get a % number or appear in the table of contents.This work is the culmination of effort and assistance made by a number of people. First of all, I would like to take the chance to thank my family.  To my parents for providing the support and guidance I always needed. To my sister for igniting the flame for pursuing Engineering and getting a chance to study a subject area I was genuinely passionate about.For proposing this work and spending the time to mentor me throughout this year, I give thanks to Nicholas Cameron, Mozilla and the Rust community. My supervisor, Dr. Alex Potanin for providing support throughout this project and for reviewing the drafts of this report.To Rust, and its suporters for bringing about the motivation for which this work has developed. Without the existing infrastructure brought forth by the community, this project would not have been possible.Lastly to my friends and peers studying Engineering and Computer Science, without them I would have lost my way a long time ago.
